# Lit review: what was listed previously already. There is also notes.md in control_ repo.
last ICRA was impressive to me. has one screwdriver work in there. 

+ A manipulation framework for compliant humanoid COMAN: Application to a valve turning task https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7041434
  coman.md 2014
  definitely cite, and study deeper

- Towards valve turning using a dual-arm aerial manipulator https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6943037
  US and Croatia, 2014 / aerial2014.md
  don't use

* Robotic valve turning: axial misalignment estimation from reaction torques https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10801385
  campolo24.pdf


- Research on Robot Screwing Skill Method Based on Demonstration Learning  ? https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/1/21
  bad journal - don't use

- A Robotic End-Effector for Screwing and Unscrewing Bolts From the Side . https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9834067
  yunkai-ma.md 2022, all CN authors
  it's about the tool design

* Forces Analysis on Robotics Screwing Tasks . https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58676-7_45
  AutomatizationByRobots.pdf

-- Would need to separate manipulator work from the drill work -- 

+ Sensor Integration and Fusion for Autonomous Screwing Task by Dual-Manipulator Hand Robot https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705812027294
  shauri2012.md 2012 ! 
  probably makes sense to cite, but not much to use from there because too old-school

- Robust Fastener Detection Based on Force and Vision Algorithms in Robotic (Un)Screwing Applications https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/9/4527
  bad journal

* Robot screwing state detection based on tactile sequences ! https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10664903
  postpone, no full-text yet

- Collaborative Robotics in Construction: A Test Case on Screwing Gypsum Boards on Ceiling ! https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9303061
  havula.md 2020
  can be cited for completeness sake, but isn't technical

- Design, Sensing, and Control of a Novel UAV Platform for Aerial Drilling and Screwing https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9363592
  ding21.md NJ,US - via screwdriver
  they argue that typical "research" tasks (like peg in a hole) are too entry level

- Automated Aerial Screwing with a Fully Actuated Aerial Manipulator https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9981979
  schuster22.pdf

+ Collaborative Screwdriving: Integrating Robot Optimal Sequence Algorithms for Increased Efficiency - thesis - https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/215536?mode=simple
  has the real examples for nut screwing in industry

* A Contact-Adaptive Control Framework for Co-Manipulation Tasks with Application to Collaborative Screwing - !!! -  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9900522
  postpone, no full-text yet

+ Robotic Fastening with a Manual Screwdriver - !!! -  https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/jia/files/inline-files/ICRA23.pdf
   jia23 - not a gripper, but a screwdriver
   jia24 - they did an embodiment with a robot
   basically, one doesn't need anything else beyond this
